# Summarizing YouTube Transcripts & Blog Posts

Here, I have summarized YouTube Video Transcripts & Blog posts with SOTA models. The Video Summarization was done through the **facebook/bart-large-cnn** model from HuggingFace Transformers. With the **sshleifer/distilbart-cnn** model, we fetched and scraped a blog post to return its summary to the user. Lastly, the latest **Pegasus** model from Google was also run to generate an Abstractive summary of the text from the corpus given, which can generate text from its own & doesn't use the text from the corpus! All these approaches use current technologies in Text Summarization applying recent breakthroughs.

  
## üöÄ The Result

Extractive Summary models *(Bart)* was able to reduce the size of the text corpus to 20-30%, while still retaining the meaning of the corpus. The Abstractive Summary model *(Pegasus)* often returned only a couple of sentences even after providing a giant corpus.
